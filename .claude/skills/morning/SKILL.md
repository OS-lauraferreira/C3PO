# Morning Routine

This skill helps you start your day with a structured morning routine.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather context

Before greeting, collect today's context in parallel:

1. **Yesterday's notes** — Read the most recent daily note from `log/daily/`.
2. **Calendar** — Run the `/calendar` skill to get today's schedule from Google Calendar. This uses Playwright to navigate to Google Calendar day view, take an accessibility snapshot, and parse events into a markdown table.
3. **90-day goals** — Read `goals/90_day.md` for current priorities.
4. **Inbox** — Check `inbox.md` for any pending items.

### Step 2: Brief the day

Start with: **"Good morning Laura! Let's do this!"**

Then present a brief greeting with:
- Summary of yesterday's carry-forward items (if any).
- Today's calendar at a glance — the parsed event table from `/calendar`, highlighting conflicts, tentative events needing RSVP, and estimated focus time blocks.
- Suggest the 3 most important topics to work on today based on goals and calendar shape.

### Step 3: Ask questions

Ask the following questions one at a time, wait for my response, then move to the next:

1. Which initiatives or projects are you focusing on today?
2. Any specific meeting I should help you get context with?

### Step 4: Create daily note

After I answer, create today's daily note in `log/daily/` with the filename format YYYY-MM-DD.md (e.g., 2026-01-24.md):

- Date and day of week as the title.
- Today's calendar summary (event count, meeting hours, focus time).
- My top priorities as a checklist.
- Brief context for any specific meetings.

Keep the format clean and scannable.

## Tips

- Keep the greeting brief and actionable.
- Focus on what matters today.
- Don't overwhelm with too many tasks.
- If the calendar shows back-to-back meetings, flag it — suggest what to protect or reschedule.
- If an event needs RSVP, mention it early.
