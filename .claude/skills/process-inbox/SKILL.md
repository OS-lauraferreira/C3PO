# Process Inbox

This skill processes your inbox — triaging each captured item to the right place in your vault.

## Instructions

Read `inbox.md` and identify all items under `## To Process`.

If there are no items to process, say so and stop.

For each item, apply the processing guide from inbox.md and present a recommendation:

```
Item: [the item text]
Actionable? Yes/No
Urgent? Yes/No
Owner: Me / Team / Not me
Type: Task / Idea / Decision / Person context / Reference
Suggested destination: [specific file path]
```

Present all recommendations together, then ask:

1. Here's how I'd triage these items. Want me to proceed, or change any of them?

After I confirm (or adjust), for each item:

1. **Task (urgent)** → Add to today's daily note in `log/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` as a `- [ ]` item
2. **Task (not urgent)** → Add to the relevant initiative in `initiatives/` or to `goals/90_day.md` if it maps to a priority
3. **Idea** → Add to the relevant file in `frameworks/` or `initiatives/`
4. **Decision** → Create or append to a file in `decisions/`
5. **Person context** → Add to `people/@Name.md` (create the file if it doesn't exist)
6. **Reference / not actionable** → Delete or note why it's being dropped
7. **Delegate** → Add to the person's note in `people/@Name.md` with a `- [ ]` tag and note it's delegated

After moving each item:
- Mark it as done (`- [x]`) in inbox.md
- Move it from `## To Process` to `## Archive`

When all items are processed, confirm what was moved where.

## Tips

- Process the inbox regularly — ideally daily or every few days
- If an item is vague, ask me to clarify before triaging
- Items that connect to 90-day goals should be flagged as higher priority
- If a file doesn't exist yet (e.g., a person note or initiative), offer to create it
- Don't overthink categorization — the goal is to get items out of the inbox and into the right context
- Multiple sub-items under one checkbox can be split if they belong in different places
