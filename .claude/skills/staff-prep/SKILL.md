# Staff Meeting Prep

This skill prepares you for staff meetings or leadership team meetings by pulling together team context, active initiatives, open decisions, and generating a focused agenda.

## Instructions

Read the following files for context:
- `teams/health_tracker.md` (if it exists) for team health overview
- `initiatives/_dashboard.md` for active initiative status
- `decisions/decision_log.md` (if it exists) for pending decisions
- Recent daily notes from `log/daily/` (past 5 days)
- The most recent weekly review in `log/weekly/`
- `goals/90_day.md` for current priorities

Ask me the following questions one at a time, wait for my response, then move to the next:

1. What type of meeting is this? (Your staff meeting / skip-level group / cross-team sync / leadership review)
2. Who's attending?
3. Are there specific topics or decisions you need to drive?
4. Anything happening in the org that needs addressing? (Reorgs, incidents, launches, morale issues)

After I answer, generate the prep document and output it directly (don't save to a file). Format:

```markdown

After showing the prep, ask:

5. Want me to save this to `meetings/raw/YYYY-MM-DD-staff.md`?

## Tips

- Put the hardest topic first — energy is highest at the start
- Every agenda item should have a clear "ask" — no topics without purpose
- If you're sharing information only, say that — don't pretend it's a discussion
- Flag if team health signals suggest something that needs airtime
- Keep to 3-4 agenda items max — more than that and nothing gets depth
- If decisions/decision_log.md has pending items, surface them — staff meetings are where decisions get unstuck
- Connect agenda items to 90-day goals when possible — keeps the team focused on what matters
